# Stock-Level-Prediction
As part of the Cognizant and Forage Virtual Experience Program, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on sales and sensor data, trained a Random Forest model to predict stock levels, and explored using more complex algorithms like Neural Networks for better stock management.

**Data Exploration**:
  Received datasets containing sales and sensor data.
  Explored the datasets to understand the structure, columns, and data types.
  Checked for any missing values and handled them appropriately.
  Visualized the distribution of numeric and categorical columns to gain insights.

**Problem Framing**:
  Discussed the client's problem statement: "Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to   more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?"
  Decided to use supervised machine learning to predict stock levels.  
  
**Data Modeling**:
  Explored the data model provided by the Data Engineering team and decided on the necessary data for modeling.
  Selected relevant columns for predicting stock levels and performed feature engineering as needed.

**Model Building**:
  Utilized a Random Forest Regressor as the initial algorithm for prediction.
  Split the data into training and test sets for cross-validation.
  Trained the model with K-fold cross-validation and evaluated its performance.

**Model Interpretation**:
  Visualized feature importance to identify significant predictors for stock levels.
  Analyzed the insights obtained from the model.  
  
**Quality Assurance**:
  Ensured code quality and followed best practices in coding.
  Documented the Python module with comments for easy understanding by the ML engineering team.

**Project Summary**:
  Prepared a concise PowerPoint presentation summarizing the data, strategic plan, feature importance, and overall findings.
  Reported the results and insights to the client using business-friendly language.
  This project was part of the Virtual Experience Program offered by Cognizant and Forage, and it involved tasks in Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Modeling, Model      Building and Interpretation, Machine Learning Production, and Quality Assurance.
